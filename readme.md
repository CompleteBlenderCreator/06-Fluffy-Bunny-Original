# New Version Of Blender
* Update your version of Blender.
* Look at the settings changes I will be using.
* Enable your first couple of add-ons!

# Planning Our Project
* Get familiar with rabbits!
* Look at the desired outcome and plan our modelling journey towards that goal.

# Planning Our Project
* Rabbit is sat in grass and is still.
* It is a summers day with a light breeze.
* There should be additional foliage around the rabbit.
* The Rabbit does not have to be realistic.

# Knowing Your Subject
* Re-enforce the importance of reference material.
*See what happens when you just plough forward with out consulting your reference material, like I started to do!

# Layers
* Know how to turn layers on and off.
* Turn on the layer management tool.
* Understand layers are useful for working on separate parts of a scene or even model.
* Realise if a layer is OFF the final render will not contain anything that was on that layer.

# Meta Balls
* Learn how to add a meta ball.
* Use them to quickly build up a base framework.
* See they’re great for modelling organic objects.
* Understand they need converting afterwards to a mesh so we can add further detail.

# Basic Sculpting
* Learn the basics of sculpting.
* Adjust your brush’s type, strength and size.
* Understand how ‘Dyntopo’ works and when to use it.
* How to find a brush if you have deleted it!

# GPU Rendering In This Section.
* Understand that Even With a dedicated GPU you may end up with out of memory issue if your card doesn’t have enough RAM.
* Some AMD cards may not render hairs correctly.

# Basic Sculpting Solution Video
* See my solution to the ‘Define Your Bunny’s Shape’ Challenge

# Your First Particle System
* Create a particle system.
* Understand children and how they relate to their parents.
* Hopefully avoid crashing your computer! (or waiting a VERY long time)

# Fake Users
* Learn how to give your hair/fur colour!
* Understand about Fake Users and how to use them.
* Realise what the 0 before anything in Blender means.

# Particle Editing
* Be introduced to the Particle Edit option.
* Learn how to edit the particles
* Style the hairs to make them flow in a more natural manner.
* Learn how to reset the hairs back to default state.

# Weight Painting
* Use weight painting and vertex groups to control where the particle system actually appears, and where it does not.

# Adding Randomness with Children
* Adjust the particle’s settings to get a more realistic and less uniform hair appearance.

# Multiple Cameras
* Add another camera to the Scene
* Change the primary camera
* Learn how to quickly move the camera around.
* Change the Camera Properties.

# Exporting and Particle Systems
* See how particle systems export from Blender.
* Learn how to convert them.
* Understand that this can break your modelling flow.
* Realise you may be better off using the particle system in the other program you are exporting too.

# Hiding Objects
* Learn more about Hiding objects in Blender.
* See how to Hide everything except the object you are working on.

# Introduction To The Image Editor
* Make the Iris for our Bunny.
* Learn how to Export an image with transparency.
* Only Use Blender- so there will be some limitations.
* Understand there are better programs for image creation and editing (Photoshop, Gimp etc.)

# Combining Shaders In Cycles
* Give the Eye a material that is a combination of different Shaders using the node editor.

# UV Unwrapping and Texture Mapping
* Understand an image texture replaces the colour of a material.
* Learn how to Unwrap part of a mesh and apply the texture to it.

# Adding a Sky Box
* Add a skybox to our scene.
* Use that skybox as the primary light source for the whole scene.

# Using Textures Vs. Geometry
* Understand you need both.- The texture has to exist on something!
* See that Geometry is for detail and textures are for the illusion of detail.
* Realise that the appropriate combination of both is used to create models

* If You did get a TDR error use your CPU or try the fix here: http://artificialflight.org/blog/2013/cycles-crash-cuda-tdr-error/
* Lots of Texture on top of one another works well.
* Save time with scene setup, lose time rendering.

# Importing Images As Planes
* Setup the Add-on that enables you to import images as planes.
* Be able to import an image into a scene.
* Realise this can be another way of importing reference material.	

# Packing External Data
* Learn how to embed images into the blend file, both individually and collectively.
* Understand this is essential when sharing a file with someone else.
* Can create bloat if the external data becomes obsolete. -Show you how to remove external data	

# Importing Images As Planes
* Learn how to use cycle’s nodes to apply transparency to your image.
* Use groups for nodes you wish to use again.

# Node Type Overview
* Look at the Nodes that are created for the textures.
* Learn about the different types of connection points and what the coloured dots are.
* Which ones can be connected together and what they would do.

# Textures With Transparency
* Learn how to use cycle’s nodes to apply transparency to your image.
* Use groups for nodes for simplicity
* Use those node groups again on other materials.

# Textures Without Transparency
* Import an image without a transparent layer.- No Alpha Channel.
* Understand that this is useful if you have no image editing software, no time to process a load of images, or just trying out images for your textures

# What is Alpha?
* If an image contains an alpha channel, each image pixel is represented has an value which specifies the opacity of that pixel. In alpha channels, 100% is opaque pixel and 0% is transparent pixel.​

# Not the best way…
* Ideal to have a Solid coloured background, either 100% Black or 100% White to separate the image from the background.
* It would be best if your images are processed to include an alpha (transparency) channel RGBA.
